\begin{abstract}
Our workshop aims to explore the synergies between causality and large models, also known as ``foundation models,'' which have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across multiple modalities (text, images, audio, etc.). Despite their high performance, the opaque nature of these large models raises crucial questions regarding their trustworthiness, especially in safety-critical domains. 
A growing community of researchers is turning towards a more principled framework to address these concerns, better understand the behavior of large models, and improve their reliability: causality.
% Here to leverage causal inference as a framework to systematically address and enhance the understanding and reliability of these models. 
Specifically, this workshop will focus on four directions: causality \textit{in} large models, to assess their causal reasoning abilities, causality \textit{for} improving large models, causality \textit{with} large models to enhance causal inference and discovery methods, and causality \textit{of} large models to understand and control their internal mechanisms. 
The invited speakers and panelists (almost all of which have already been confirmed to attend) represent a diverse set of perspectives and expertise, across both academia and industry.
The workshop is organized by a team of 12 members from six different institutions across North America, Europe, and Asia, ensuring diversity across research interests, backgrounds, and demographics. Visit our website: \url{https://calm-workshop-2024.github.io/}

\section{Topic}

The remarkable capabilities and accessibility of recent large models, also known as ``foundation models,'' have sparked significant interest and excitement in the research community and beyond. In particular, large pre-trained generative models have demonstrated remarkable competencies in understanding and generating human-like text despite being trained on largely unstructured data using relatively simple self-supervised learning objectives. This raises the question: (A) \textit{Why do such large models work so well?} % for, in
% instruction following, agentic behaviors

The impressive performance, sometimes even exceeding human experts, across a wide variety of benchmarks, together with the incorporation of multiple modalities such as images, text, and audio, makes these large models particularly versatile decision-making systems.
However, the increased adoption of these models is not without challenges. The increasing size and complexity of these ``black box'' models raises concerns about their trustworthiness and reliability.
For real-world applications, where distribution shifts are pervasive and sufficient high-quality data may be difficult or expensive to collect, it is crucial to systematically verify and enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of these models.   
This is especially pertinent in safety-critical domains, such as healthcare and policy-making. %, where decisions have significant real-world impact.

% Our workshop will explore the many exciting synergies between causality and large models. 

With the striking potential of causality and the enormous interest in tackling the many open questions about understanding and improving large models on the other, we propose a workshop that aims to explore the many exciting synergies between causality and large models.
Specifically, we identify four main directions to cover in our workshop: 

% (1) Causality \textit{in} large models, (2) Causality \textit{for} large models, (3) Causality \textit{with} large models, and (4) Causality \textit{of} large models.

\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
    \item \textbf{Causality \textit{in} large models}: Assessing the causal knowledge captured by large models and their (causal) reasoning abilities.
    % A growing area of research in this direction is to investigate the causal knowledge captured in large models despite being trained on unstructured, observational data.

    % how multiple modalities enable more causal reasoning (?)
    \item \textbf{Causality \textit{for} large models}: Applying ideas from causality to augment and improve large models.
    % Building off of efforts towards causal representation learning, we aim to share ideas on inductive biases inspired/grounded in causality for the large-scale regime
    \item \textbf{Causality \textit{with} large models}: Leveraging large models to improve causal inference and discovery.
    % is that recent large models appear to be able to perform some causal reasoning and extract some causal knowledge without deliberate or intended incorporation of causality in their conception.

\end{enumerate}

By engaging both theoretical and applied perspectives, we aim to foster deep insights into the behavior of large models, not only to assess their current capabilities but also to improve their performance and to make their behavior more interpretable and reliable. In addition to the directions discussed above, we welcome contributions that explore the vibrant interface between causality and large models, for example:

\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Theoretical and empirical studies on how large models employ causal knowledge and reasoning
    \item Combined applications of large models and causal methods to real-world problems for improved performance and interpretability 
    \item Connections between multiple modalities (such as images, text, and audio) and (causal) reasoning abilities of large models
    \item Applications of causal inference methods to understand or improve large models
\end{itemize}

% [specific criteria (for call for papers)]


\paragraph{Schedule}

Our workshop will feature a mix of invited talks, a poster session, a panel discussion, and interactive elements to engage the audience and foster discussion. Consequently, we do not expect to need any special equipment.
We plan to hold a series of six invited talks given by both up-and-coming as well as distinguished researchers with experience in the intersection of causality and large models, as well as a panel discussion for deeper dialogue on the workshop's main themes. Overall, we estimate that our workshop will run for a full day (approximately 8-9 hours), with a preparatory rough breakdown as follows:


\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item 30 min: Opening and closing remarks
    \item 6 x 30 min: Invited talks
    \item 60 min: Panel discussion
    \item Up to 60 min: Contributed talks
    \item 60 min: Poster session (with up to an additional 60 min during coffee breaks)
    \item 90 min: Lunch break (with a voluntary ``lunch buddy'' program to connect participants)
    \item 2 x 30 min: Coffee breaks
\end{itemize}



% [lunch buddy program] to connect not just junior+senior people for lunch but also connecting different communities
    % To connect junior and senior researchers and simultaneously encourage cooperation between the causality and large model communities, we---inspired by the success of a similar initiative at the NeurIPS workshop NeurReps---plan to setup a ``lunch buddy" system between the participants, making our workshop more interactive.


Taking inspiration from a similar idea at the NeurIPS 2022 workshop NeurReps and to foster a more interactive and engaging environment, we plan to include a ``lunch buddy'' program to connect junior and senior researchers, as well as researchers from different communities, for lunch. 
Attendees as well as participants will be able to sign up for this program throughout the morning of the workshop before lunch, self-reporting their research interests and experience level, then we will randomly pair them up and provide them with a list of suggested topics to discuss during lunch.
This will provide an opportunity for participants to network and engage in discussions with researchers that have different backgrounds, but similar research interests.

% Our workshop will feature a mix of talks, panel discussions, and interactive elements to engage the audience and foster discussion. We plan to have a total of 6 talks, 2 panel discussions, and 1 interactive session. The schedule will be structured to allow for ample time for questions and discussion, as well as breaks to encourage networking and collaboration among the participants.


% We also selected several notable researchers that focus on adjacent or applied fields to provide our attendees with insights in how state-of-the-art methods can rapidly and effectively be deployed to solve problems.

\paragraph{Relevance and Impact}

Although there have been several past workshops focusing on various aspects of large models at NeurIPS and other major conferences, to our knowledge, there has not been a workshop that specifically focuses on the intersection between causality and large models.
This is particularly unfortunate, given the recent rise of large models leading to an explosion of attention in the research community and beyond. 

However, there has been a growing interest in making causality more accessible to the machine learning community and fostering research at the intersection between the two fields, as evidenced by several past Causal Representation Learning workshops. We hope to carry on this mission by discussing how causal methods can enable more principled approaches and potentially even new capabilities such as systematic generalization or robustness. However, we aim to focus on large models as they represent a paradigm shift in machine learning, not only in terms of performance but also the social implications of their increasingly widespread deployment.
% has brought new challenges and opportunities that are rife for deeper discussion

Since this is the inaugural workshop on this topic, it is difficult to estimate the number of contributions or attendees. However, judging by the 2022 UAI workshop on Causal Representation Learning which had 32 submissions, we expect up to 70 submissions, since NeurIPS is a larger conference, and our workshop involves the trending topic of large models. Estimating the number of attendees is also challenging, but judging by the reception by invited speakers and reviewers, we expect a high interest in the topic, so we estimate upwards of 200 attendees.

\section{Team}

Our organizing team is very fortunate to benefit from not only considerable experience both in breadth and depth, but also in exceptional diversity in terms of research interests, backgrounds, gender, and demographics. With 12 members spanning six different affiliations across six different countries in North America, Europe, and Asia, we are well-positioned to bring together a diverse set of perspectives and expertise to our workshop.

Despite this commendable diversity, our team is larger than recommended by the NeurIPS guidelines. This is partially due to multiple different groups independently working towards organizing a workshop on this topic, which we decided to merge into a single united effort. All our organizers can devote their full attention to making the workshop rewarding for contributors, speakers, and attendees, as no organizers are additionally organizing on other workshops in parallel.
However, we believe that for this topic, the size of our team is not only appropriate, but also beneficial. 
By bringing six institutions together, we have access to a large pool of potential reviewers ensuring that each submission receives at least three quality reviews, enabling us to, by our estimates, already have about one-third of the necessary reviewers confirmed.
Additionally, our organizing team includes several junior researchers and a high variance in experience organizing workshops in the past. This makes this workshop a unique opportunity for many students to gain valuable experience in organizing a workshop at a major conference.

% we can draw from a wider range of expertise and facilitate knowledge transfer regarding the best practices of organizing workshops.
% We believe that
% the benefits of having a larger team outweigh the potential drawbacks, as it allows us to draw on a wider range of expertise
