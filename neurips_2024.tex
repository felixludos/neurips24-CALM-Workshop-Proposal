\section{Topic}

The remarkable capabilities and accessibility of recent large models, also known as ``foundation models,'' have sparked significant interest and excitement in the research community and beyond. In particular, large pre-trained generative models have demonstrated remarkable competencies in understanding and generating human-like text despite being trained on largely unstructured data using relatively simple self-supervised learning objectives. This raises the question: (A) \textit{Why do such large models work so well?} % for, in
% instruction following, agentic behaviors

The impressive performance, sometimes even exceeding human experts, across a wide variety of benchmarks, together with the incorporation of multiple modalities such as images, text, and audio, makes these large models particularly versatile decision-making systems.
However, the increased adoption of these models is not without challenges. The increasing size and complexity of these ``black box'' models raises concerns about their trustworthiness and reliability.
For real-world applications, where distribution shifts are pervasive and sufficient high-quality data may be difficult or expensive to collect, it is crucial to systematically verify and enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of these models.   
This is especially pertinent in safety-critical domains, such as healthcare and policy-making. %, where decisions have significant real-world impact.

% For example, by systematically identifying failure modes

% we can gain insights into the causal factors that affect the model's behavior. 
% This can lead to more interpretable and explainable models, while also promising to improve model out-of-distribution generalization and robustness by avoiding spurious correlations and non-causal biases in the data.

% Our workshop will explore the many exciting synergies between causality and large models. 

With the striking potential of causality and the enormous interest in tackling the many open questions about understanding and improving large models on the other, we propose a workshop that aims to explore the many exciting synergies between causality and large models.
Specifically, we identify four main directions to cover in our workshop: 

% (1) Causality \textit{in} large models, (2) Causality \textit{for} large models, (3) Causality \textit{with} large models, and (4) Causality \textit{of} large models.

% In - Studying the causal knowledge captured by large models
%   - Evaluating the causal knowledge that emerges out of standard training schemes
%   - Do LMs do âamortized causalityâ (Bernhardâs term)?
%   - Related to: Psychometrics, behavioral sciences
%   - References: causal parrots, CLadder, Causal Reasoning in LLMs (2305.00050)
%   - Example application: holistic benchmarking
%   - Example approach: evaluate model biases with a synthetic benchmark
% - Of - Understanding the causal structure of how large models work
%   - Focus is on exploiting the structure of large models to make them more interpretable/controllable
%   - Related to: Mechanistic interpretability, alignment, neuroscience
%   - Example application: explainable/trustworthy AI
%   - Example approach: Identify what components of the model cause problematic behavior
% - For - Applying causal methods to improve large models

\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
    \item \textbf{Causality \textit{in} large models}: Assessing the causal knowledge captured by large models and their (causal) reasoning abilities.
    % A growing area of research in this direction is to investigate the causal knowledge captured in large models despite being trained on unstructured, observational data.
    % amortized causal inference - causal knowledge *emerges* out of large-scale observational data 
    % how multiple modalities enable more causal reasoning (?)
    \item \textbf{Causality \textit{for} large models}: Applying ideas from causality to augment and improve large models.
    % Building off of efforts towards causal representation learning, we aim to share ideas on inductive biases inspired/grounded in causality for the large-scale regime
    \item \textbf{Causality \textit{with} large models}: Leveraging large models to improve causal inference and discovery.
    % is that recent large models appear to be able to perform some causal reasoning and extract some causal knowledge without deliberate or intended incorporation of causality in their conception.
    \item \textbf{Causality \textit{of} large models}: Investigating the causal structure of how large models work and how to make them more interpretable and controllable. 
    % Exploiting the rich framework of causal inference to understand the impressive capabilities of large models
\end{enumerate}

By engaging both theoretical and applied perspectives, we aim to foster deep insights into the behavior of large models, not only to assess their current capabilities but also to improve their performance and to make their behavior more interpretable and reliable. In addition to the directions discussed above, we welcome contributions that explore the vibrant interface between causality and large models, for example:

\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Theoretical and empirical studies on how large models use causal knowledge for reasoning
    \item Applications of large models to real-world problems leveraging causal methods for improved performance or interpretability 
    \item Links between multiple modalities (such as images, text, and audio) and (causal) reasoning abilities of large models
    \item Causal methods that are readily applicable and useful to understanding or improving large models
\end{itemize}

% [specific criteria (for call for papers)]


\subsection{Speakers and Schedule}

Our workshop will feature a mix of invited talks, a poster session, a panel discussion, and interactive elements to engage the audience and foster discussion. 
We plan to hold a series of six invited talks given by both up-and-coming as well as distinguished researchers with experience in the intersection of causality and large models, as well as a panel discussion for deeper dialogue on the workshop's main themes. Overall, we estimate that our workshop will run for a full day (approximately 8-9 hours), with a preparatory rough breakdown as follows:


\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item 30 min: Opening and closing remarks
    \item 6 x 30 min: Invited talks
    \item 60 min: Panel discussion
    \item Up to 60 min: Contributed talks
    \item 60 min: Poster session (with up to an additional 60 min during coffee breaks)
    \item 90 min: Lunch break (with a voluntary ``lunch buddy'' program to connect participants)
    \item 2 x 30 min: Coffee breaks
\end{itemize}



% [lunch buddy program] to connect not just junior+senior people for lunch but also connecting different communities
    % To connect junior and senior researchers and simultaneously encourage cooperation between the causality and large model communities, we---inspired by the success of a similar initiative at the NeurIPS workshop NeurReps---plan to setup a ``lunch buddy" system between the participants, making our workshop more interactive.


Taking inspiration from a similar idea at the NeurIPS 2022 workshop NeurReps and to foster a more interactive and engaging environment, we plan to include a ``lunch buddy'' program to connect junior and senior researchers, as well as researchers from different communities, for lunch. 
Attendees as well as participants will be able to sign up for this program throughout the morning of the workshop before lunch, self-reporting their research interests and experience level, then we will randomly pair them up and provide them with a list of suggested topics to discuss during lunch.
This will provide an opportunity for participants to network and engage in discussions with researchers that have different backgrounds, but similar research interests.

% Our workshop will feature a mix of talks, panel discussions, and interactive elements to engage the audience and foster discussion. We plan to have a total of 6 talks, 2 panel discussions, and 1 interactive session. The schedule will be structured to allow for ample time for questions and discussion, as well as breaks to encourage networking and collaboration among the participants.


% We also selected several notable researchers that focus on adjacent or applied fields to provide our attendees with insights in how state-of-the-art methods can rapidly and effectively be deployed to solve problems.

\subsection{Relevance and Impact}

Although there have been several past workshops focusing on various aspects of large models in NeurIPS and other major conferences, to our knowledge, there has not been a workshop that specifically focuses on the intersection between causality and large models.

There has been a growing interest in making causality more accessible to the machine learning community, as evidenced by the several past Causal Representation Learning workshops. We hope to carry on this mission by discussing how a causal framing can enable more principled approaches and potentially even new capabilities such as systematic generalization or robustness.

[specialized teams and responsibilities]

[program committee and discussion of reviewing process]

% [number of organizers] dedicated specialists (deep bench of experience); we are bringing two different communities together. organizers need to cover not just one but two communities (and everything in between); knowledge transfer from experienced organizers; larger pool of reviewers to pull from (more institutions/groups involved)
    Our workshop brings together two communities, which requires experts from both as organizers. This enables us to have access to a larger and more diverse set of reviewers. Furthermore, our organizing team facilitates knowledge transfer regarding the best practices of organizing workshops, as it includes several junior people for whom this is the first experience as an organizer.
